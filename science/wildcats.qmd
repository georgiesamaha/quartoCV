While genomics has enabled vast improvements in the quantification of genome-wide diversity and the identification of adaptive and deleterious alleles in model species, wildlife species have not reaped the same benefits. In resource constrained species, alternative genomic approaches that reduce costs and computational resources can be used to inform conservation management. In the absence of species-specific reference genomes, the availability of a reference genome from a closely related species can provide a reliable substrate for performing variant discovery. Domestic cats benefit from high-quality reference genome assemblies and share a high degree of genomic synteny with their wild counterparts. In this project, I evaluated and demonstrated the value of cross-species application of various genomic resources developed for the domesitc cat in the Sumatran tiger, snow leopard and cheetah.
