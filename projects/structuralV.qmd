Like many other rare and heritable conditions, mapping the causative genetic loci of peripheral neuropathies can be challenging due to a lack of available population-level data and standardised methodologies available to the research community. I have worked closely and collaboratively with the Australian motor neuropathies community to develop reproducible and sensitive protocols for identifying clinically relevant genomic events in patient cohorts and families. 

#### My role

* Design and implement a protocol for filtering variants under expected modes of inheritance 
* Design and implement a public, sensitive, and reproducible workflow for identifying and annotating structural variation 
* Identify candidate causative genomic events 
* Liase and collaborate with bioinformaticians, clinicians, and geneticists to optimise a bioinformatics workflow 

#### Outcomes

* Workflow: [GermlineStructuralV-nf](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/Germline-StructuralV-nf)
* Results currently under embargo

#### Skills 

* Software engineering, data analysis, project management, verbal and written communication
* Disciplines: bioinformatics, genomics, genetics    
* Platforms: HPC, cloud
* Tools: bash, Nextflow, Nextflow Tower, python, PBS, SLURM, Singularity, git, GitHub
