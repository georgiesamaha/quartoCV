title: "Flattening the Nextflow learning curve"

Workflow frameworks, like Nextflow, have recently emerged as solutions to the challenges posed by bioinformatics pipelines. Bioinformatics data processing typically comprises many individual steps that accept and output varying file formats, and require the use of multiple coding languages and pieces of software. While Nextflow offers a nice solution for creating reproducible, portable workflows that are easy to run, it comes at the cost of a steep learning curve. Nextflow's users need to learn yet another Domain-Specific Language (DSL) and a new and foreign programming paradigm in order to get the most out of Nextflow. 

As a part of the Australian BioCommons [Bring Your Own Data platforms project](https://www.biocommons.org.au/byo-data-platform-expansion), we prioritised Nextflow over other workflow frameworks in our workflow development activities, developer support, and training programme due to its growing popularity in the community. 

#### My role

* Developed a Nextflow workflow template that provided a framework and recommendations to workflow developers new to Nextflow 
* Developed and deployed Nextflow workflows on HPC and cloud platforms
* Deployed nf-core workflows on HPC and cloud platforms 
* Configured and optimised Nextflow and nf-core workflows for national compute platforms and Nextflow Tower 
* Developed and delivered Nextflow and nf-core training events to a national audience  
* Contributed to and liased with the Nextflow and nf-core communities 

#### Outcomes

* [Nextflow DSL2 template](https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/Nextflow_DSL2_template) GitHub repository
* [Customising nf-core workshop](https://www.biocommons.org.au/events/custom-nfcore)
* [RNAseq workshop](https://www.biocommons.org.au/events/rnaseq-2022)
* Project currently in progress

#### Skills 

* Data analysis, software engineering, project management, verbal and written communication
* Disciplines: bioinformatics 
* Platforms: HPC, cloud, RStudio 
* Tools: bash, R, python, PBS, SLURM, git, GitHub, Nextflow, Singularity, Docker
