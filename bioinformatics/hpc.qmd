Bioinformaticians and life scientists are increasingly turning to high performance computing infrastructure and efficient, scalable workflows as their research becomes more data intensive. Accessing and getting the most out of these facilities can be challenging for many of us who have never received formal computational sciences training. This webinar series I designed and delivered with colleagues across national computational infrastructure providers introduces the high-performance computing facilities and services available to Australian researchers and ways to access and use them to do high impact research.
