Bioinformatics data processing typically comprises many individual steps that accept and output varying file formats, and require the use of multiple coding languages and pieces of software. While Nextflow offers a nice solution for creating reproducible, portable workflows that are easy to run, it comes at the cost of a steep learning curve. Nextflow’s users need to learn yet another Domain-Specific Language (DSL) and a new and foreign programming paradigm in order to get the most out of Nextflow.\nAs a part of the Australian BioCommons Bring Your Own Data platforms project, we prioritised Nextflow over other workflow frameworks in our workflow development activities, developer support, and training programme due to its growing popularity in the community.\n\nMy role\n\nDeveloped a Nextflow workflow template that provided a framework and recommendations to workflow developers new to Nextflow\nDeveloped and deployed Nextflow workflows on HPC and cloud platforms\nDeployed nf-core workflows on HPC and cloud platforms\nConfigured and optimised Nextflow and nf-core workflows for national compute platforms and Nextflow Tower\nDeveloped and delivered Nextflow and nf-core training events to a national audience\n\nContributed to and liased with the Nextflow and nf-core communities\n\n\n\nOutcomes\n\nNextflow DSL2 template GitHub repository\nCustomising nf-core workshop\nRNAseq workshop\nProject currently in progress\n\n\n\nSkills\n\nData analysis, software engineering, project management, verbal and written communication\nDisciplines: bioinformatics\nPlatforms: HPC, cloud, RStudio\nTools: bash, R, python, PBS, SLURM, git, GitHub, Nextflow, Singularity, Docker"

    "text": "While genomics has enabled vast improvements in the quantification of genome-wide diversity and the identification of adaptive and deleterious alleles in model species, wildlife species have not reaped the same benefits. In resource constrained species, alternative genomic approaches that reduce costs and computational resources can be used to inform conservation management. In the absence of species-specific reference genomes, the availability of a reference genome from a closely related species can provide a reliable substrate for performing variant discovery. Domestic cats benefit from high-quality reference genome assemblies and share a high degree of genomic synteny with their wild counterparts.
