I'm a community-focused bioinformatician, working on improving the accessibility of bioinformatics for all life scientists. I prioritise the importance of inter-disciplinary collaboration, effective communication, and transparency in achieving this. I maintain a complementary research practice in animal genomics, with a focus on improving health and conservation outcomes in companion animals and non-model species.
