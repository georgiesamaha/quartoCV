I work at the Sydney Informatics Hub, University of Sydney, and Australian BioCommons, directly supporting Australian researchers by developing open-source tools and solutions and consulting on reproducible research practices and best-practice bioinformatics.

I am the product owner for the Australian BioCommons' [BioCLI](https://www.biocommons.org.au/biocli) and University of Sydney's Sydney Research Cloud projects. My interest lies in making computing infrastructure and bioinformatics methods more approachable, particularly for life scientists who are new to compute-based research.
